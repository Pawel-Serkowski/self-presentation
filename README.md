## About me and this project
Hi, my name is Pawe≈Ç and I dream about being a great programmer. I did this portfolio as a part of competition task.
The process of it was kind of hard for me because I got myself a challange and first I did a project (visualization in Figma) and after that I really started coding.

## Technologies
* ReactJS
* Api for sending mails
* HTML & CSS

## Setup
After clonning it you have to run:
````
$npm install
$npm run dev
````
After that the page will run on localhost specified in terminal.
